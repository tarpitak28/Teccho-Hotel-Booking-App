# Hotel Booking (React + Vite)

A simple hotel booking frontend built with React and Vite. This repository contains a client app that includes pages for listing rooms, viewing details, user bookings, and a hotel owner dashboard.

---

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js (>=16) and npm or Yarn/pnpm
- A Clerk publishable key for authentication: `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

**Quick Start**

1. Open a terminal and go to the client folder:

```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn
# pnpm install
```

3. Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) file in `client/` with your Clerk publishable key:

```env
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

4. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The Vite dev server typically runs on http://localhost:5173.

**Build & Preview**

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

**Project Structure**

The important files and folders (workspace root contains `client/`):

**Notes**

- The app uses Clerk for auth; ensure `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set before starting.
- Routing is handled with `react-router-dom`. Hotel owner pages are nested under `/owner`.
- Styling uses Tailwind (see `index.css`).

**Useful scripts (from `client/package.json`)**

- `npm run dev` — start Vite dev server
- `npm run build` — build production bundle
- `npm run preview` — preview production build locally
